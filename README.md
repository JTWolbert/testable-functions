### Naming Conventions âœ…
Considering the following naming conventions.

* Folders will be named like the other repos. Ex: `example-folder-name`
* File Names are SnakeCase. Ex: `Example_File_Name.py`
* Function names are Pascalcase. Ex: `ExampleFunction()`
* Variable names should be Camelcase. Ex: `exampleVariable`
* *Will consider using Camelcase and Pascalcase for functions and classes respectively, and using Hungarian notation for variables and Snakecase for file names.*
